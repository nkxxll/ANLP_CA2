[TASK]
Your task is to analyze detailed structured video game reviews to extract relevant topics based on the provided categories. These categories are defined below, ranging from gameplay aspects to technical concerns:

Topics Include:
- Gamemode (e.g., online, singleplayer, multiplayer)
- Bugs (e.g., crash, gamebreaking)
- Visuals (e.g., graphics, animation)
- Sound (e.g., music, ambience)
- Hardware Requirements (e.g., performance demands)
- Price (e.g., value, costly, affordable)
- Gameplay (e.g., mechanics, difficulty, duration)
- Story (e.g., narrative, characters)
- Support (e.g., developer responsiveness)
- Online Play (e.g., server issues, player community)
- Updates (e.g., new content, patches)
- Seasonal Content (e.g., events, season updates)

Instructions:
1. Train the model using manually annotated example data to recognize and predict topics within reviews.
2. For each new review, identify applicable topics from the list above.
3. If a review does not fit into any predefined topics, categorize it as “no relevant topic”.
4. Consider the app name and voter sentiment when analyzing the review, as they provide contextual clues to enhance topic prediction accuracy.

This comprehensive approach will ensure the identification of relevant topics while considering the context of the review, which is crucial for personalization and enhancing user experience on gaming platforms.
