            "review": "remnant be an excellent sequel that besides some minor and one major issue improve on everything the original do on such a scale that i highly encourage pick it up for anyone even slightly interested in soulslike fromsoft game even if the gun focus do not seem initially like your jam there be much that be familiar and the rest be a nice change of pace from other soulslike game the randomization aspect of level and loot be reason enough to provide gameplay for a good while in this review i will go over some of the basic of what make this game so good while be vague so as to not spoil any of the experience this review be write after the first dlc launch and it will be update if anything significant happen as the rest of them be release first off the archetype the best thing i can say about the class system of this game be that i hope other game will steal the idea from this one as the way remnant do it be brilliant each class provide a selection of three active ability of which only one can be equip and use at a time and several passive perk along with a powerful prime perk that provide a major change to how you play the game the medic class for instance can recover estus charge your heal potion if you be new to the genre by heal ally allow them to keep themselves and others alive longer their ability heal in various way and can even revive fallen ally back to their foot once you have the item for a class you can swap them at any time thus allow you to freely switch up whenever you feel like you can also have two class equip at a time provide many unique combination of ability and passive perk it be a blast to think of and play as different combination with many of them have synergy with each other there be a good selection of class to start from and you can unlock more by find obscure secret as you play through the game some be not all that powerful but even the worst one have their use case secondly the loot you can equip up to four different ring an amulet a long gun a hand gun a melee weapon an estus flask and your choice of four armor piece weapon mod and mutators also affect how you play of these the one that stand out the most be rings amulet weapon mod and weapon ring and amulet provide passive effect to your character with some vary from boost reload speed damage or just give you a chance to not consume estus upon use amulet often have more powerful unique effect like release toxic gas upon switch weapon or cause reloads to only consume half the ammo you reload ring tend to be more minor but still retain significant effect on your build with more than amulet and more than ring in the game there be plenty to choose from weapon vary in effect from bow to rifle to shotguns with most have their own unique niche that they fulfil basic long gun and hand gun can equip weapon mod while bos weapon and unique weapon usually have their own custom weapon mod that can not be remove weapon mod be like spell you can fire from your gun with some just dealing damage some firing heal energy while others create new weakspots on hit enemy most gun and weapon mod be useful or even build define with some fall short compare to what others provide again there be plenty to choose from melee weapon also exist but theyou re much more simplified compare to common soulslike weapon each one have a combo string a heavy attack and a backlash attack many of the unique weapon change how you use them with some be throwable while others might leave a damage over time effect melee combat be a great alternative to use ammo on common enemy but against many of the boss it be either reckless or basically impossible estus flask or relic as the game call them come in many variety some heal you instantly on use others heal over time some provide other bizzare way to regain health with unique one to choose from this system be like if salt and sanctuary healing be overhaul and expand on not all be make equal but the stand out one can define how you build your character not go to spoil them of course armor be divide into light medium heavy and ultra heavy variety it use a similar weight base system common to soulslikes where wear heavier armor grant you better defence at the cost of slower invincibility roll and more stamen consumption while lighter armor allow you to roll faster at the cost of less resistance there be good variety in aesthetic with some be fantasy like some be just utilitarian armor while others be just something like a cowboy costume armor do not provide anything beyond defence which be a shame since they have ability in the first game but the other loot provide them in spade thirdly boss fight the main boss be a treat unique fight that have a twist that change up the normal dodging and weaving of normal fight they be challenge and satisfy to take down and even the minibosses pose a unique threat two especially memorable fight that everyone will meet regardless of randomization be sure to stick out love or hate theyou re excellent in provide a unique challenge you can not find elsewhere the final bos will thoroughly test you and your build do not be discourage keep up the fight skeleton now you know the basic of what make this game cool all that be leave be to mention the few issue the game have major issue performance with the release of the first dlc performance have take a dive i do not mean that it be a constant low framerate mess just that sometimes in some area it dip below what it should be my computer can run the game on ultra setting just fine but in some of the dlc area the framerate have be reduce to less than a single frame every second while the computer scream in agony these dip tend to pass after a while but it have get me kill more than once if you do not plan on get the dlc this should not affect you atleast accord to some user report which might not be reliable minor gripe economy scrap the main resource of the game be hard to come by environmental object and common enemy drop pitiful amount while chest boss and minibosses provide slightly more all in all you can not afford much beyond upgrade your main weapon until you start grind an area you have already explore once again the highest yield of scrap can be gain from pick up either amulet ring you already have or tome of trait after you have reach the trait cap as a result the consumable item like buff potion be almost a bad investment when compare to save for buy permanent power in the form of new weapon weapon mod and weapon upgrade if it be up to me i boost income by introduce item like the soul from dark soul or rune from elden ring a pickup that grant you scrap upon consume it these could drop from any viable loot source and if theyou d boost the player income by say you have enough to go around for buy consumables or try new weapon from the shop or whatever else you might use it for story the main story be very barebones it be just an excuse to go see cool world and shoot enemy for loot no lore channel will spring forth to explain the main story as there be not much to go on the world building for each of the area be interesting and fun to read",
